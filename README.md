# Light/Dark Mode
Websites that have Dark Mode are my favorite. It is less painful on the eyes. So I created this project to play around with toggling between light/dark. It is a mock site, so please excuse the lame placeholders. ^__^


## About
This is a mock website that toggles between light and dark mode. Please excuse the low quality gif. Will have this available via Github Page.
